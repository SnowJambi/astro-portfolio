  <h2>Hi, I'm <b>Lachlan</b></h2>

    <div class='summary'>
      <p>I'm an eager frontend developer based in Canberra, doing my best to keep up with and learn the latest
        technologies in the rapidly advancing world of web development.</p>

      <p>You can probably find me brushing up on my JavaScript skills on codewars, following courses to learn
        new
        skills, or reading as much as I can about the current frontend landscape (someone send help, there's
        like
        50
        chrome tabs open about JavaScript frameworks).</p>

      <p>I have completed a Certificate IV in Programming at Canberra Institute of Technology which has given
        me some experience in working with SQL, C++, Java, and broader programming principles such as those of
        Object
        Oriented Programming. The course also taught a little about project management and development
        methodologies
        such as Agile.</p>

      <p>If I'm not working I'm probably playing some bass guitar, out riding my motorbike or sitting back
        watching the
        MotoGP with an IPA.</p>
